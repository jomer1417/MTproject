        My name is Jomer Bagay, I am 19 years old I live in Barangay 23 Santa Cecilia San Nicolas Ilocos Norte, and I am currently in my second year of college, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology, major in Computer Technology. I chose this program because I am deeply interested in learning how technology works, especially in areas such as computer systems, programming, and other applications that are useful in today's modern world. Aside from my academic journey, I also have several hobbies that I truly enjoy. One of my favorite activities is playing basketball. It helps me stay active, build teamwork, and develop discipline, while also giving me a way to relieve stress. I also enjoy watching movies, which allows me to relax and explore different stories, cultures, and perspectives. Another hobby of mine is riding and driving a motorcycle. For me, it is not just a form of transportation, but also a passion that gives me a sense of freedom and adventure. As a student, I am motivated to do my best in my studies and to continue improving myself both academically and personally. I believe that with dedication, hard work, and perseverance, I will be able to achieve my goals in the future and contribute meaningfully to society.
