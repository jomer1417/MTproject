    <h1>DAMILI FESTIVAL</h1>
   
    <p>
        In San Nicolas, Ilocos Norte, December is a month of thanksgiving for all the blessings received throughout the year, celebrated through the Damili Festival. This festival lasts for a month and includes dances, parades, shows, beauty contests, trade fairs, exhibits, and sports events. The highlight happens in the last week of December, with the Dance Pageantry, a street dance competition that shows the town's traditional craft - damili or pottery.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The festival is a way for the people to honor and preserve this old tradition. The main product, the banga or clay pot, has become a symbol of Ilocano heritage, passed on through generations. The Dance Pageantry presents the different stages of pottery-making, from gathering clay to firing the pots, set to the Ilocano song Agdamdamili. This performance reflects the Ilocano values of humility, hard work, and love for life. All barangays join the street dance, wearing colorful costumes inspired by old times and using props like clay pots, farming tools, and animals.

    <h1>History of San Nicolas</h1>
    <p>
        Like any other town in the then singular province of Ilocos, San Nicolas was established by Augustinian missionaries. Vigan, the first Spanish mission center in this region, was founded in 1572. In the year 1575, when the Spaniards first explored the Laoag (Padsan) River, they met hostile resistance from the natives of San Nicolas and Laoag. In another expedition dispatched from Vigan in 1584 San Nicolas was established and Laoag followed a year later.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        San Nicolas Catholic Church built in 1701 is one of the oldest buildings in this province. Its original structure is one of the must see places of the town. The Church and the attached Santa Rosa Academy Building, the well preserved Municipal Hall and the old Town Plaza sprawled between them constitute the heart of the town center. These buildings and structures are originally built and continue to be festooned with earthen bricks, which is among the products of the surviving locals.
