    <h1>DAMILI FESTIVAL</h1>
   
    <p>
        In San Nicolas, Ilocos Norte, December is a month of thanksgiving for all the blessings received throughout the year, celebrated through the Damili Festival. This festival lasts for a month and includes dances, parades, shows, beauty contests, trade fairs, exhibits, and sports events. The highlight happens in the last week of December, with the Dance Pageantry, a street dance competition that shows the town's traditional craft - damili or pottery.

        The festival is a way for the people to honor and preserve this old tradition. The main product, the banga or clay pot, has become a symbol of Ilocano heritage, passed on through generations. The Dance Pageantry presents the different stages of pottery-making, from gathering clay to firing the pots, set to the Ilocano song Agdamdamili. This performance reflects the Ilocano values of humility, hard work, and love for life. All barangays join the street dance, wearing colorful costumes inspired by old times and using props like clay pots, farming tools, and animals.
